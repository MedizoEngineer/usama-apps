      <p>
        Hello! My name is Usama, and I am a 3rd-year MBBS student. Although I initially chose to pursue a career as a doctor, I have decided to transition into the field of software development, driven by my passion for technology and its potential to transform medicine through advancements in AI and ML.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a beginner-level learner in various fields, yet I am proficient in Python, TypeScript, and web and app development. Currently, I am focusing on Kubernetes, 3D modeling, and machine learning techniques as my major interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I aim to showcase educational content that merges my interests in medicine and technology, providing valuable resources for learners like myself.
